🔥 Fire Detection Project
This project focuses on detecting fire in images or real-time video streams using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It can be used in surveillance systems, smart homes, or forest fire alert systems to automatically recognize the presence of fire and trigger an alert.

🚀 Features
🔍 Real-time fire detection using webcam or video file

📸 Image classification for fire/no-fire detection

🧠 Deep Learning model (CNN-based or pre-trained)

🛠️ Built with OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and NumPy

🔔 Alert system integration (sound, notifications, etc.)

🖥️ Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV
TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch
NumPy
